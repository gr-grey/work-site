Getting bored waiting ages for conda to solve the environment?

I did. 

I am trying to install [Orca](https://github.com/jzhoulab/orca/),  the  `conda env create -f orca_env.yml` command was stuck at "Solving environment: -| / \ / \" for 1hr+. 

Bored and frustrated, I searched for a better option, 
then I found  [Libmamba: A Faster Solver for Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community), and it was amazing.

Installation and setup of Libmamba is simple. After installing miniconda3, run these commands
```bash
conda update -n base conda
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

With Libmamba, it took only a couple of minutes to solve the environment!!!

I highly recommend this. Try it out today, no more hours long waiting, it'll change your life for the better  ğŸ“£ (ad person voice).

P.S.
The solution came from this conda issue:
["Solving Environment" takes forever, as always, and it remains without result. Â· Issue # 11919 Â· conda/conda (github.com)](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/11919).

Where the person complained:

> The message I received after 4 hours of waiting
```
