If we want multiple quartz websites (e.g. one for serious stuff one for fun), we need multiple repos.
But github does not allow forking a repo twice, so here's a workaround.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git gr-grey.xyz
# cd to dir
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:gr-grey/gr-grey.xyz
git push -u origin v4

# set upstream for future updates
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git

npm i
npx quartz create

npx quartz build --serve --port 8081 
# or
npx quartz build --serve --port 8081 --wsPort 3002
```

Basically by cloning the repo and reset origin, we link it to our own github account, and by setting upstream we can sync it when quartz version is updated.

Upgrade to quartz 4.0

 - save content somewhere else
 - fetch and sync to v4 branch (force, discard conflicts changes)
 - npm i, npx quartz create, Copy and existing folder, choose how links are resolved, pick shortest path (may need to update links later)
 - npx quartz build --serve
 - restore content/.gitkeep
 - git ignore dot obsidian 
 - add all, push to v4
 - edit quartz.config.ts, change site name and base_url
 - add .github/workflows/deploy.yml according to [Hosting (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting) page
 - add the  file, not commit
 - go to github repo, change default branch to v4
 - go to page -> source select github action
 - locally, run npx quartz sync, it commits the deploy.yml
 - it's served at gr-grey.github.io, not gr-grey.github.io\/repo name, maybe because base_url was set to be just gr-grey.github.io


Log what I have done to use quartz as my new site.

1. Forked the repo [jackyzha0/quartz: ðŸŒ± host your own second brain and digital garden for free (github.com)](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
2. Renamed it to gr-grey.github.io
3. Deploy it by allowing read and write permission, and set github page publish (though not sure if necessary since the github.io name change) [Deploying Quartz to the Web (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/).
4. Configure: change baseURL in "config.toml" and cname in ".github/workflows/deploy.yaml"
5. push changes `git push origin hugo`
