This course is part of [Genomic Data Science Specialization [6 courses] (Johns Hopkins) | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science).

It covers the math and practical implementation of algorithms for DNA sequence alignment and assembly.

2. [[Boyer-Moore Matching Algorithm]]: *the art of giving up*.  Coding example - [Colab notebook to play with](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gr-grey/genomic-courses/blob/main/boyer_moore_matching.ipynb).
3. [[Indexing The Genome - Pattern Matching, Kmer, Sorted List and Hash Table]]
4. [[Approximate Matching - Hamming and Edit Distance and Pigeonhole Principle]]
5. [[Edit Distance Calculation - Recursive Edit Distance of Prefixes]]: calculate edit distance by reducing the problem to smaller sub-problems of edit distance, and calculate recursively.
6. [[Smith-Waterman dynamics programming for calculating edit distance]]: Â remembering the answer of the smaller sub-problems to massively reduce repetitive calculations.
