Exons, introns, UTR,  CDS: 
----
  - A gene contains a lot of sequence segments that don't maps to amino acids (aren't codons). The regions that codes protein are called **exons**, they are short segments separated by non-coding sequences called **introns**.

  - A gene is transcribed (via 1:1 mapping) to a pre mRNA. The pre mRNA contains all the non-coding sequences.
  - **Splicing**: The introns then get cut out of the pre mRNA, and only exons remains in the matured / messenger RNA (mRNA).
  - mRNA starts with **untranslated regions** (UTR) at 5' end -> exons/**coding sequences** (CDS) -> 3' UTR, then ends with a poly A tail.
  - **Alternative splicing**: the exons can be shuffled around and ends up in a different order than they are in the original DNA sequences. This allows one gene to code multiple proteins. 
  - Over **90%** of human genes undergo alternative splicing, meaning knowing the coding region does not directly lead to protein sequence.
