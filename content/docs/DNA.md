Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): nucleotides building blocks (AGCT) stringed together. 
----

- 4 types of nucleotides building blocks **AGCT**: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine. 
  - A and G are purines (bigger), T and C are pyrimidines. 
- **DNA double-helix**: 2 strings of poly nucleotide chains. 
  - The two chains are complimentary to each other, where an A always pairs with a T (and vice versa) in the other string, and a C paris with a G (and vice versa).
  - The two chains form a twisted double-helix shape (like a revolving ladder), where each step is an A-T or C-G pair.
  - A-T pairs are connected via 2 hydrogen bonds, where as C-G forms 3 hydrogen bonds.
  - **5' and 3' end**: each chain has a direction
    - One end of the chain has an unreacted phosphate group at carbon 5 of the nucleotide, called 5'end.
    - The other end has an unreacted -OH group at carbon 3 of the nucleotide, called 3' end.
  - DNA sequence is written from 5' to 3'- a  **positive** or **+ strand**. Its reverse compliment generate the sequence of the paired chain - the **negative strand** (also from 5' to 3').
