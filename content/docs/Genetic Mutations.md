When comparing two genomes (strings), the differences can occur in 3 ways: substitution, insertion and deletion of one or more characters.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
---
 refers to the difference where only one character (one nucleotide letter) is substituted by another in the genome.

Small insertions/deletions (INDELs) 
----
refers to the difference where one or more characters are inserted or deleted in the genome.

INDELs happen less frequently than SNPs and are harder to call.

_De Novo_ mutations (DNM)
----
occur when sperms/eggs were produced. These are new mutations seen in the new generation but not in parents.

DNMs occur **~30-40 per haploid** genome (in one sperm or egg), meaning each offspring carries ~70 to 80 DNMs. Calculation: **human mutation rate** 1.1 x 10^-8 bp per generation, times 3.1 billion bp, leads to ~34bp per gamete cell.
