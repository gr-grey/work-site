3D structure: histones, chromatin and chromosome
----

- **Chromosomes** contain all the DNAs in the cell nucleus. Fully stretched DNA is about 2 meters long. The double helix structure has to be tightly packaged in the nucleus.
- The double helix wraps around histones and form a "beads on string" structure, The **histones** pack together into **chromatin** fiber, that eventually lead to chromosomes.
